                        Those two men, the assassins. I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my     brother-in-law. Because of this 'intervention' I am alive. And yet, I think that this person was playing a much deeper game. He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout not a silent assassination. 
                        In one stroke, he bloodied both sides - set the American and Mexican governments against the Cartel, and cut off the supply of  methamphetamine to the southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to  himself. The rewards would be... enormous. 
                        We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life. And  more than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the same. One issue, which troubles me, I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends. You know why I do this. I want security for my family. 
                        No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up.
